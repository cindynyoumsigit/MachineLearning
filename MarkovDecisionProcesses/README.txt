## This is a description of how to run the code I implemented for CS7641 Assignment 2.

There are a total of 2 Jupyter notebooks, one notebook for each dataset I ran all the unsupervised and dimensionality reduction algorithms onI implemented.

File 1: Adultdataset.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of two unsupervised learning algorithms
and four feature selection and dimensionality reduction algorithms with a combination
among each other for a total of 16 combinations and a final classification using
Neural Networks with each of these combinations on the adult data set.
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 2: Creditdataset.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of two unsupervised learning algorithms
and four feature selection and dimensionality reduction algorithms with a combination
among each other for a total of 16 combinations and a final classification using
Neural Networks with each of these combinations on the credit data set.
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"
