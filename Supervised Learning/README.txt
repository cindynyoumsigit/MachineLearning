## This is a description of how to run the code I implemented for Assignment 1.

There are a total of 5 Jupyter notebooks, one notebook for each model I implemented.

File 1: DecisionTree.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of Decision Tree Classifier with pruning on both the Adult and Credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 2: NeuralNetworks.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of a Neural Network on both the Adult and Credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 3: Boosting.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of a Boosting Ensemble model using Decision Trees as base estimator on both the Adult and Credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 4: SVM.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of a Support Vector Machine on both the Adult and Credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 5: KNN.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbor Model on both the Adult and Credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"
