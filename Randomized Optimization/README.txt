There are a total of 4 Jupyter notebooks, one notebook for each model Optimization Problem I implemented.

File 1: Knapsack.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of four randomized Optimization algorithms in order to solve the Knapsack Optimization Problem.
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 2: N-Queens.ipynb
What it does: IIt contains my implementation of four randomized Optimization algorithms in order to solve the Knapsack Optimization Problem.
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 3: FlipFlop.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of four randomized Optimization algorithms in order to solve the Knapsack Optimization Problem.
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"

File 4: NeuralNetworks.ipynb
What it does: It contains my implementation of three randomized Optimization algorithms in order to find the best weights for my NN model which
I used to do class predictions on the UCI credit datasets
How to run: Simply go to the top bar of the notebook, click on "Kernel" --> "Restart and run all"
